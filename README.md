# CS61B Spring 2018: Homework, Labs, and Projects

## Overview

This repository contains my implementations of the homework assignments, lab exercises, and projects for the CS61B: Data Structures course at the University of California, Berkeley for the Spring 2018 semester.

## Course Description

CS61B covers the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, emphasizing the implementation and analysis of these structures in Java. Key topics include:

- Object-oriented programming
- Recursion
- Linked lists, arrays, and other collection types
- Trees, graphs, and hash tables
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Memory management
- Performance analysis

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **homework/**: Contains my solutions to the assigned homework problems.
- **labs/**: Includes my completed lab exercises, designed to reinforce lecture topics through hands-on practice.
- **projects/**: Contains the major projects for the course, including:
  - **Project 0: NBody Simulation**
  - **Project 1: Data Structures**
  - **Project 2: Build Your Own Game (BYoG)**
  - **Project 3: Bear Maps**

## Project Highlights

### Project 0: NBody Simulation

- Simulated the motion of N celestial bodies affected by gravitational forces in a two-dimensional space.
- Implemented algorithms to calculate gravitational forces and update the velocities and positions of the bodies.
- Utilized StdDraw library to visualize the simulation.

### Project 1: Data Structures

#### Part A: Data Structures

- Implemented a dynamic array (ArrayDeque) and a doubly linked list (LinkedListDeque).
- Developed unit tests to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the data structures.

#### Part B: Applying and Testing Data Structures

- Implemented Union-Find/Disjoint Set data structure for solving dynamic connectivity problems.
- Conducted extensive testing of data structures to verify their functionality and performance.

#### Part 1 Gold: Autograding and Advanced Topics

- Set up an autograder to automatically evaluate the implemented data structures.
- Explored advanced topics and optimizations to handle larger datasets and complex queries efficiently.

### Project 2: Build Your Own Game (BYoG)

- Developed a roguelike dungeon crawler game with procedurally generated worlds.
- Utilized object-oriented programming principles to design game mechanics and interactions.
- Employed data structures like graphs and queues for game state management.

### Project 3: Bear Maps

- **Map Rendering:** Implemented a tile-based map display using a quad tree for efficient management and rendering of map tiles.
- **Routing:** Developed a shortest path calculation feature using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **Location Search:** Created an autocomplete search feature using a Trie data structure for fast prefix-based location searches.
- **Graph Data Structure:** Represented the map’s intersections and roads with nodes and edges.
